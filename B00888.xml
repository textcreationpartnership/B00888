            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:183664:35"/> Whereas the Chriſtians dyrect all theyr doing, to the glory of God, and <note place="margin">What Chriſtians ought to reſpect in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> profit of their neighbours. They weigh more the feare of God, then worldlye glory: the loue of Iuſtyce, then deceytful prayſe: and eternall blyſſe, more then temporall pleaſure. The <hi>Ethnikes</hi> if there were any notable thing in them: vaunted as of their owne gyfts: but the Chryſtians acknowledge God to be the geuer and aucthour of all good gyftes. The vertue of humilitye, then which Chriſt ſo earneſtly requireth of vs, was wanting in the Infydelles.</p>
            <p>The ſame that hath bene ſayd gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye <note place="margin">Of the workes of <hi>Ievves, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi> and <hi>Turkes.</hi>
               </note> of the <hi>Ethnikes,</hi> may be perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly extended to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Turks:</hi> who woulde ſéeme to acknowledge one God onely, to deteſt all Idols, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in holyneſſe of lyfe: yet becauſe they worſhip not God as he hath reueled and appointed in his word, neyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that Chriſt is the ſonne of the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God: al their works, muſt nedes be fowle, in Gods ſight. For without that, ther is no true vertue, no knowledge of God, nor ſyncéere worſhipping of God:
<pb facs="tcp:183664:36"/> no pure loue toward God, nor towarde our neyghbour. They fayne vnto them ſelues a God, or rather an Idoll, who is not the Father of our medya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and redéemer Ieſus Chriſte. Therefore they worſhyppe not God a ryght, (for, <hi>Hee that knoweth not the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh.</note> 
               <hi>Sonne, honoreth not the Father)</hi> nor yet calleth vpon his name. And becauſe the holy ghoſt is geuen for the Sonnes ſake vnto beléeuers, to ſtyrre vp newe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in theyr hartes: it is euident howe farre from all goodneſſe, <hi>Iewes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Turkes</hi> are: whyles they deſpyſe the ſonne of God: who onelye ſendeth the holy ghoſte vnto men, to bréede in them all perfyte goodneſſe: Moreouer, for that the true loue of God (from whence all loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde our neyghbour is deryued) ryſeth in vs vppon that aboundaunt mercie, which he hath ſhewed, in geuing his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſonne Chriſt, to be crucyfied for our ſinnes: whome the <hi>Iewes</hi> &amp; <hi>Turkes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempne, and blaſpheme: it can not bée that they contempning him, ſhoulde ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely loue God: or theyr neyghbour for Gods ſake.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:183664:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> So then both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Turkes,</hi> want the chéefe and principall vertues of Chriſtians, the true knowledge, and feare of God, fayth, Charyty, hope, inuocation of Gods name, gyuing of thanks, obedience in ſorrowes and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, with others of that ſorte. And if happely there be any ſhewes or pyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of Politicke vertues in them, thoſe are ſo defiled and ſpotted, wyth impure affections, that they looſe all their bewty. We ſée in beaſts them ſelues, ſome thing reſembling vertue: <note place="margin">A ſimilitud</note> as in the <hi>Lyons</hi> clemency, toward ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants: in the Dogge, faythfull toward his Maſter: in Shéepe, ſoftneſſe and meekeneſſe, and yet theſe are not true vertues: it is euen ſo almoſt in the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles, whoſe reaſon being voyde and deſtitute of the lyght of Gods ſpirite, wandereth in Ignoraunce and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and can do no true and ſinceere vertue: but happelye nowe and then ſome vayne maſke and ſhewe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: and thus much of the works of <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyms</hi> and Infydels.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, thoſe good works
<pb facs="tcp:183664:37"/> are to be conſydered, which are done of <note place="margin">Of the workes of faythfull Chriſtians.</note> thoſe, who from the bottome of theyr harts, embrace true holyneſſe, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.

<pb facs="tcp:183664:37"/> profeſſors of the goſpell, ought moſt certainly to perſwade them ſelues: that <note place="margin">Good workes are eſtabliſhed, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by the doctrin of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by fayth.</note> they are adopted fréely by God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie iuſtifyed through Chriſt by <hi>faith,</hi> and regenerate and ſanctifyed by Gods ſpyrite, that they might in worde and deede expreſſe, and ſomewhat reſemble, the nature and diſpoſition of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father: and therewithall decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the worlde by theyr workes, that they are the ſonnes of God. For that cauſe I haue againe, &amp; againe repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before that a Chriſtian faith ought to be garniſhed with al kind of good works. And therfore as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <hi>VVe gather therfore that a man is iuſtified by faith, without the workes of the Lawe,</hi> In the waye of queſtioning ſayth: <hi>VVe make the Lawe therefore in vaine through faith?</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth by &amp; by: <hi>God forbid, Naie, we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtablishe the Lawe.</hi> Euen ſo I preſently affirme, that we do not now a daies, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue good workes, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of faith: <hi>Iuſtifiynge,</hi> but we rather eſtabliſhe the ſame.

            <pb facs="tcp:183664:38"/>
            <p> Moreouer, almighty God him ſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth of his ſeruants, the good works <note place="margin">God requy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth good workes of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</note> of a true fayth: and greeuouſly accuſeth, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth by the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, thoſe that are neglygent and ſlouthfull. <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſayth in the Lawe: <hi>And nowe Iſraell, what doth the Lorde thy God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi>

            <p>I repeated once or twyſe before, that the tenne commaundementes, are the moſt certaine, &amp; moſt abſolute platforme of good workes. Which thing that it maye more euydently appeare, I wyll by a briefe enumeration (as it were in a table) noate and poynt out the ſame. Vnto the fyrſt commaundement, wée <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> maye referre the feare of God, fayth,
<pb facs="tcp:183664:47"/> loue, and aſſured hope in aduerſitye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with patience and conſtancie. The ſecond commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement containeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> all true worſhypping of God, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding of al ſuperſtition and Idolatry. The third commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, the reuerence of Gods name, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with inuocation &amp; confeſſion of the ſame. And the fowrth commaundement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> calleth for the preaching of Gods word, publique prayers, and for external wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhypping and ſeruing of God: allowing alſo ſéemely and moderate ceremonies, and eſpecially ſuch as maye tende to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying in the church of God. Vnto the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> fyfth we may referre pittie towarde our Parents, countrey, &amp; kynſfolkes, lawful obedience vnto the Magiſtrate, and all ſuperiours, and the offices in cyuile life. The ſirte commaundeth iuſtyce, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> iudgement, the defending of the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. &amp; widdowes, and the delyueraunce of thoſe that be oppreſſed, benefycencie, &amp; innocencie. The ſeuenth comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. faith and trouth, betwéene maryed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> perſons, and dueties of matrymonie, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and godly education of chyldren,
<pb facs="tcp:183664:47"/> the loue of chaſtitie, and ſobrietie. Wée maye referre vnto the eyghth, iuſtice in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> contracts and bargaynes, munifycencie, lyberalytie, and hoſpytalyty. Vnto the nynth we may referre, the loue &amp; ſtudye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> of trouth throughout all our lyfe, fayth in worde and déede learned, honeſty, and profitable communication. And vnder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the tenth are conteyned, good and godlye affections, togeather with all holy, and honeſt cogitations. And this is a verye briefe and compendious fourme &amp; rule of good workes: Which if you woulde haue more contract and ſhort, you maye conſider the ſpéeche of Chriſt, deuyding the ſame into two generall parts: <hi>Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Wherein this is principally to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, <note place="margin">The lawe requireth internel o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> that the dyuine lawe, the ſum or effect whereof is the loue of God, and our neighbour: doth not requyre of thoſe that be iuſtified, onely externall workes
<pb facs="tcp:183664:48"/> and dyſcipline: but alſo the interiour and ſpyrituall motions of the hart, conſonant to the holy wyll of almighty God, as our ſauiour Chriſte him ſelfe beareth wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſaying: <hi>You shall be perfect, euen</hi>

            <p>The laſt parte of the diſcription of <note place="margin">The endes of good workes.</note> good workes remayneth touching theyr ende. For I ſayd that all the good works of the regenerate, ought to reſpecte the glory of God, the ornament of our liues, &amp; the commodity of our euen Chriſtian.

But rather that God might be gloryfied amongſt men: that they might ſhewe theyr obedience in walking worthy of theyr vocation, to the comfort and profit of their brethren.

            <p>Séeing then the excellent dignitie of Chriſtian men is ſuche: let them alſo thinke that theyr lyfe, and conuerſation, ought to be moſt excellent, and to paſſe all other Nations or profeſſions. For <hi>Paynimes</hi> and all faythleſſe people, doo leade a lyfe, without any faith or hope, they know nothing of eternall lyfe.

               <hi>wytneſſe, thou shalt not luſte: and if there be any other commandement, it is in few words comprehended: namelie, thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. Charitie worketh not euill to his neighbour, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fulfilling of the lawe is Charitie.</hi> In this texte all the commaundementes of the lawe are referred to the loue of our Neyghbour, to wyt, in that part that the lawe was geuen to reſtraine iniuries, reſpecting cyuile ſocietie, and fellowſhyp of men: namely, that no man ſhoulde be ſo bolde to endammage his neighbour, in his body, fame, goodes, or any other waye that might redounde to his annoyaunce. For he that loueth another from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of his harte: is ſo farre from doing iniurie and wrong: that he wyll endeuor with all his might, to be profitable to his neyghbour. And whereas we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to loue our neyghbour, euen as our ſelues, in this one worde, not onely ſyncéere loue is dyſcerned from hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: but alſo all dueties of Charitie are epacted and requyred.

               <hi>and the ſpirite contrary to the flesh, theſe are contrarie one to the other, ſo that ye can not doo that which you would. The deedes of the flesh are manifeſt, which are theſe, adulterie, fornication, vncleannes, wantonnes: vvorshypping of Images, witchcraft, hatred, variaunce, emulations, wrath, ſtryfe, ſeditions, ſectes, enuyinges, murders, dronkennes, gluttonie, and ſuch lyke: of the which I tell you, as I haue told you in times paſt: that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they which do ſuch things, shal not inheryt the kingdom of God. But the fruite of the ſpirit is loue, ioy, peace, long ſuffering, gentlenes, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, faith, meekenes, temperancie: againſt ſuch there is no law. They truely that are Chriſtes, haue crucified the flesh, with the affections and luſtes. If we lyue in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, let vs alſo walke in the ſpirit.

For this is the wyll of God, euen your holines, that you should abſtaine from fornication: that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one of you should knowe howe to keepe his veſſel, in holines and honor.

            <p>In theſe few words, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle declareth very plainly what maner of life a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man ought to lead: expreſſing the chéefe &amp; principal vertues both toward God and man: firſt he would haue vs lyue ſoberly, that is to ſay, honeſtly, ſhamfaſtly, chaſtly temperatly, &amp; frugally: not vncomly, not wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tonly, not immodeſtly, not incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, wherein he exhorteth vs to ſubdue &amp; vanquyſh all kind of concupiſcences and luſts, &amp; to withdraw as it were our mynd from the ſociety &amp; contagion of the body.

Chriſtes meaning therefore, was not that men ſhould Iniuriouſlye get ryches to geue Almes thereof, neyther is it néedefull that all partes of the Parable ſhoulde be lyke. For in the Application of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milytude, we ought to ponder the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſcope, and not to reſpect any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance and particle. The chéefe ſtate or ſcope of the ſymilytude, is not in the collation of a fraudulent mynde, not in Infydelity or theft: but in the wyſe and prouident forcare in purchaſing frends, whoſe example therein our Sauiour would haue vs to followe. He dyd this that being put out of his offyce, thoſe whome he had gratified, would receiue him into their houſes: this ought wée to doo in ſpirituall matters, that when we ſhall haue néede we may be receyued
<pb facs="tcp:183664:95"/> into euerlaſting Tabernacles. Chriſt our ſauiour blameth them in that place, mannes contempte, of celeſtiall and eternall thinges: whoſe dyllygence and care, is great, and alwayes buſyed about thinges néedefull for his body, which are but worldly, and temporall.</p>
            <p>But to returne to my matter, which is, that wée ought to bée Chryſtians, <note place="margin">The daye of doome to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</note> not onelye in worde, but alſo in déede, that wee maye bée feared from vyce, and allured to vertue: lette vs ſette before our eyes alwayes that dreadfull daye. Whiche the Prophete togeather wyth the Apoſtle, nameth the daye of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anguiſhe, the daye of calamy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and myſerie, the daye of darkneſſe and blackneſſe, the daye of Clowde and whyrlewynde: when as God ſhall rewarde vnto euerye man according to his worke. Againe let the ioyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and Crowne of glorye, allure vs to vertue and godlyneſſe, whereof the Prophete alſo and the Apoſtle ſpeaketh thus. The eye hath not ſéene, the eare hath not hearde, neyther haue the ioyes entered into mannes harte, which
<pb facs="tcp:183664:95"/> God hath prepared for them that loue him. Let vs remember that we muſt once, wyll wée, nyll wee, forſake this worlde, but wée wotte not when, nor howe ſoone. <hi>Death</hi> (as one wryteth) <hi>by meanes of vncertaine chaunces, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaies</hi>

Let vs then bée alwaye readie againſt that daye, and ioyfullye looke for death, which can neuer bée farre abſent: by the example of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> who deſyred to bée looſed and to be with Chriſt. Whiche thing <note place="margin">

And if at any tyme wée ſlyppe, and ſlyde into ſynne and iniquitie: (as by nature wée are prone to doo euyll) yet let vs not ſuffer that to rule in our mortall bodye, but endeuour to ſalue ſuche ſores with good déedes, and with repentaunce, and newnes of lyfe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:183664:96"/>
            <p> But moſt part of mortall men nowe <note place="margin">The wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of our tyme.</note> a dayes haue no regarde at all of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſobrietie, but geue themſelues to ryotting and ſurfetting, and runne headlong into all kinde of miſchiefe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no feare of God before theyr eyes: they followe theyr fylthie luſtes, they ſnatche, they ſteale, they ſweare, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare, they lye, they deceaue, and to bée ſhort, doo all thinges ſauing that which is lawfull. And yet in the meane tyme they wyll néedes be accoumpted Chryſtians, &amp; goſpellers, &amp; earneſt fauourers of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygion.

And if at any tyme vnwares, or through humane imbecyllitie, they fall and goe aſtray: they wyl immediatly acknowledge their error, and pacify their

For he is gentle, and ready to forgeue, if he ſée vs ſorye and penitent: and as if we haue offended gréeuouſlie, ſo if we lament our faultes bytterly, according as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> wryteth. Wherevnto wée maye adde this, as a ſpecial conſolation and comfort, that wee haue a medyatour in heauen, euen the Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, who is our aduocate and patrone, to purchaſe peace for vs: and to make an attonement betwéene his father and vs.</p>

For there are many nowe a dayes, that flatter and deceyue them ſelues, whyles they gréedily embrace all ſuch ſentences in the Byble, which ſet out Gods great mercy: but in the meane ſeaſon, neglect and paſſe ouer lyghtly ſuch places, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to newneſſe, and holyneſſe of lyfe. The Lorde is mercyfull in déede, but
